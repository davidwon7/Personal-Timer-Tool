# Health-E Timer Tool 
A simple web application that helps remind you when to take breaks during long hours of computer usage. I realized I was looking at the computer without breaks at times, so I created this to remind myself to save my own eyes. Just a personal project done in and out over 2~3 weeks. 

Might update new features later on.

Not mobile compatible, as it uses windows notifications. No plans yet to make it mobile. 

Feel free to use it, or fork it and make any changes! This is my first solo web-application project, to learn some HTML/CSS/JS + Bootstrap/jQuery. Hope you like it!
